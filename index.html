		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle">Introduction</h2>
		
		<!--I will mostly be using special characters for brackets and colons.-->
		<p class = "mainText">CS&colon;GO &lpar;Counter Strike&colon; Global Offensive&rpar; is a competitive 5 vs 5 team-based game that was initially released in 2012. 
		The game was created by Valve&reg; &lpar;a popular game designing company&rpar;.</p>
		
		<!--Valve and CS:GO logo images have their own id's as they need to be specially formated to fit beside eachother.-->
		<img id = "v_logo" src = "valvelogo.jpg" alt = "This picture is the logo of Valve."/>

		<!--mainText is the class for a standard paragraph in the page-->
		<p class = "mainText">The game has a large community that is still growing. However, due to the game being very competitive, the game is a large market for cheats
		as they can give the player a major advantage in the game. Meme Hook is the best free cheat currently in the market!</p>
		
		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle">History</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Meme Hook has been in the CS:GO cheat market since 2012 when the game was released. For the past 7 years Meme Hook has 
		out-competed other cheats on the market due to its precision and the variety of features that it has. On this website you will learn 
		about the features that Meme Hook has and also how to download and use Meme Hook.</p>
		
		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle">Features</h2>
		
		<h2 class = "listSubtitle">Legit Hacks</h2>
			
		<p class = "mainText">Legit Hacks are features in Meme Hook that give you can advantage over other players while not making it obvious that 
		you are cheating.</p>

		</ul>
			
		<h2 class = "listSubtitle">Rage Hacks</h2>
			
		<p class = "mainText">Rage Hacks are the opposite of Legit Hack features as they are very blatant. When using Rage Hack features, you are 
		at a high risk of being banned by the Valve&reg;&rsquo;s anti-cheat systems. We recommend using Rage Hacks only when playing against other cheaters.</p>

		<p class = "important">Although we regularly update Meme Hook to prevent our cheat from being detected by VAC &lpar;CS&colon;GO&rsquo;s automated anti-cheat system&rpar;, we still cannot 
		guarantee that you will not be banned. It is up to you as the user to take responsibility for what happens to your own account. We are not responsible for any lost 
		in-game purchases such as skins. If you want to learn more about VAC, you can visit <a href = "https://support.steampowered.com/kb/7849-RADZ-6869/">Valve&reg;&rsquo;s official

		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle">Menu</h2>
		
		<img src = "menu.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of a menu that makes all the features of MemeHook easily accessibe."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">All of the features are made accessible in a toggle-based menu where you can activate and disable certain features just by clicking on the check boxes.</p>
		
		<!--Headings for the features are id's which are used in the internal links above.-->
		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle" id = "ESP">ESP Hacks</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">ESP &lpar;Extra Sensory Perception&rpar; hacks are cheats which allow you to know things that the game does not allow you to know. Most ESP hacks &lpar;such as wall hacks
		and radar hacks&rpar; allow you to know the exact location of your enemies even when they are hiding behind obstacles. Since the maps in CS&colon;GO are relatively complex and the amount 
		of players in each team is small, knowing the location of your enemies can be extremely beneficial to plan out a strategy or shoot through a thin obstacle that an enemy player
		is hiding behind.</p>
		
		<img src = "walls.gif" alt = "This picture shows glowing player models behind obstacles."/>
		
		<!--The lables of images are in a different class than "mainText".-->
		<p class = "lable">Once wall hacks are activated, you can see enemy player models through obstacles. These models are also indicated by a glow to increase visibility.</p>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Wall hacks are the most common ESP hack however there are also other hacks which enhance your in-game perception. We will go over a few other ESP 
		hacks that Meme Hook has.</p>
		
		<h3>Radar Hacks</h3>
		
		<img src = "radar.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of the radar tool in CS&colon;GO. The radar hack displays enemies on the radar as well indicated by red dots."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">The normal radar tool in CS&colon;GO allows you have a general sense of where you and your team-mates are located on the map. The location of enemy players 
		is not displayed. However with radar hacks, enemies will be indicated on the radar by red dots.</p>
		
		<h3>Player Indicators</h3>
		
		<img src = "indicators.jpg" alt = "This pictures show arrows indicating the general direction of enemy players."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">The player indicators are the small arrows at the top of the screen pointing to the general direction of enemy players. They are useful for knowing if an enemy player is trying sneak up behind you or if they are 
		just around the corner. Unlike wall or radar hacks, player indicators do not show the precise location of an enemy player.</p>

		<h3>FOV &lpar;Field Of View&rpar; Hacks</h3>
		
		<img src = "fov.jpg" alt = "This picture shows an increased field of view from your perspective."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">FOV hacks are the most simple and subtle ESP hack as all they do is increase the field of view of your first-person camera.</p>

		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle" id = "trigger">Trigger-Bot</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Not to be confused with aim-bot, trigger-bot is bound to a certain key on your computer or button on your mouse. Once this button/key is pressed, the trigger-bot will automatically fire if it detects an enemy 
		player model within your crosshair.</p>
		
		<img src = "crosshair.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of a reticule in the center of your screen called a crosshair."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">The crosshair is a reticule in the center of your screen which shows the direction of your shots. When the button/key bound to your trigger-bot is held down and there is an enemy within your crosshair, you will 
		automatically fire. This allows you to gain an edge over other players because you can react and fire faster than them. At the same time you are able to be subtle so people will not call you out for cheating.</p>
		
		<img src = "trigger.gif" alt = "This is a GIF of a player using trigger bot to eliminate two players at once."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">As we can see here, this player uses a trigger-bot to pull off a shot that would normally be very hard to do. However, at the same time the player is able to look "legit" so that no other players would suspect that 
		they are cheating.</p>
		
		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle" id = "bhop">Bunny Hops</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Normally, jumping will slow your forward movement as more of your velocity is focused upwards. More experienced players in CS:GO place a series of perfectly timed jumps to travel faster in the game. However this 
		requires a lot of practice. With our bunny-hop hacks, you will not have to worry about carefully placing your jumps as this feature will do it for you. You can use bunny-hop hacks to chase down an enemy player, reach an objective in 
		the map, or just to impress your friends. </p>
		
		<img src = "bhop.gif" alt = "This is a GIF of a player bunny-hopping in order to chase and eleminate an enemy player."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">Another advantage of bunny-hopping it that it allows you to dodge bullets easier when you are chasing enemy players.</p>
		
		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle" id = "aimBot">Aim-Bot</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Unlike the other features we have gone over so far, aim-bot is not a &quot;legit&quot; feature as it is not subtle. Once the aim-bot feature is activated, it will lock on to enemy players and fire. This takes away the need for you to aim by yourself. Your player model will create a sudden flicking motion when the aim-bot 
		locks onto other players.</p>
		
		<img src = "aim.gif" alt = "This is a GIF or aim-bot in acton as it locks on to other players."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">As you can see, the aim-bot can quickly eliminate one player and then lock of enemy player models as most of the time, a shot in the head would result instant elimination. However you can also customize Meme Hookâ€™s aim-bot to aim for the body in certain conditions if you want to.</p>
		
		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle" id = "antiA">Anti-Aim</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Anti-aim repositions the hit-boxes of your player model in order to make you harder to hit. Hit-boxes are the way most video games will decide what areas are valid to hit on the player model. Games like CS&colon;GO take this too one step further and have multiple hit-boxes on a player model. Each hit-box will yield 
		a different amount of damage.</p>
		
		<img src = "hitbox.jpg" alt = "This picture displays all the hit-boxes that a CS:GO player model has."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">Different hit-boxes yield different damages. The feet yield the least, the chest and torso yields moderate damage and the head yields the most. Most of the time shooting the head of a player model will cause enough damage to eliminate them in one shot. This is why aim-bots automatically target the heads of player models.</p>

		<p class = "mainText">By switching up the hit-boxes with anti-aim, you can switch the damage that your player model's head would normally yield with your foot and your foot could yield the damage from your head. Since most players are used to aiming for the head, they will do less damage to you as they are really just shooting your foot. This will also 
		give you an advantage in HvH &lpar;Hack versus Hack&rpar; games as aim-bots will also shoot at your head only to deal the amount of damage that would normally be done to your foot. Anti-aim will also make your player model harder for aim-bots to hit by making your player model rapidly spin or jitter.</p>
		
		<img src = "aa.gif" alt = "This is a player model spinning with anti-aim."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">Here is an example of a player model spinning when anti-aim is activated.</p>
		
		<h3>Fake Angles</h3>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Fake angles are a new anti-aim feature that we have added to Meme Hook. Fake angles create a fake player model that faces the opposite direction of your real player model.</p>
		
		<img src = "fakeangle.jpg" alt = "In this picture, the the real and fake model are back to back with each other. The real model looks normal but the fuck model is indicated by a glow."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">The fake model is indicated by a glow however, the glow is only for you to distinguish between the real and fake model. Your opponents will confuse the fake model as your real model and shoot at it but they will do no damage. The fake angles can even trick aim-bots into firing at the fake model.</p>
