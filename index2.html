		<p class = "mainText">Using a cheat in CS&colon;GO will require two parts: the dll file of the cheat, and an injector used to insert the cheat 
		into the game process.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<!--Both the CS:GO cheat and the injector are offered in this list.-->
			<li><a href = "MemeHook.dll">MemeHook &lpar;the cheat&rpar;</a></li>
			<li><a href = "GHInjectorV3.2.zip">Injector for the cheat &lpar;zipped folder&rpar;</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<!--Important notice had it's own p class as it is a different color than the normal paragraph.-->
		<p class = "important">Remember to keep these two files in the same folder in order for the dll file to be successfully injected into the 
		CS&colon;GO game process!</p>
		
		<!--Both the heading "Tutorial" and the steps are in the same heading level (h2) but they are in different classes as they will have different colors and sizes.-->
		<h2 class = "secondaryTitle">Tutorial</h2>
		
		<h2 class = "step"> Step 1&colon; Download the cheat and injector.</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Download the two files in the download section. Make sure to keep these two files in the same folder. Once you have downloaded both files, you will observe that there is a dll file and a zip file. 
		If you try to open the dll file, your computer will give you an error and nothing will happen. This is because the dll file is the cheat and it will need the injector to work. Un-zip the folder called &quot;GH Injector V3.3.zip&quot;.
		You will then find out the there are multiple files you can open. The next step will tell you which file to open.</p>
		
		<h2 class = "step">Step 2&colon; Open the injector.</h2>
		
		<img src = "openInjector.jpg" alt = "This picture shows multiple files of the injector. The 64-bit file is circled as this is the file you must open."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">As you can see there are serveral files that belong to the injector. You want to open the 64-bit injector.</p>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Once you open the injector, your computer will probably give you this notification asking if you are sure that you want to run this file.</p> 
		
		<img src = "confirm.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of the notification your computer will give you when you try to open the injector."/>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Your computer gives this notification when programs make changes to the computer. However, we assure to that these changes and necessary for the injector to work. Once you click "Yes" the injector should load 
		up on your screen and look something like this.</p>
		
		<img src = "injector.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of the injector for MemeHook."/>
		
		<h2 class = "step">Step 3&colon; Select a dll file.</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Now you will need to select the file &quot;MemeHook.dll&quot; that you downloaded earlier. You can do this by going to the &quot;Add files&quot; tab and selecting the dll file.</p>
		
		<img src = "addfiles.jpg" alt = "Here is a picture of the 'Add files' tab being circled in red pen."/>
		
		<!--Used to break up two images so one is under the other.-->
		<p></p>
		
		<img src = "choosefile.jpg" alt = "Here is a picture of the dll file MemeHook stored in a folder."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">MemeHook.dll is stored in the same folder as the injector however in this image you will realise that there are only the dll files of the injector. This is because the injector will only display dll files in order to 
		make it easier for you to find the dll you want.</p>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Once the file had been added to the injector, click the check box to the left of your recently selected dll file.</p>
		
		<img src = "checkmark.jpg" alt = "The check box beside the dll file is circled in red pen."/>
		
		<p class = "lable">When you click the &quot;Inject&quot; option, only the checked files will be injected into your game process. However you do not have to click "Inject" yet as you do not have a game process.</p>
		
		<h2 class = "step">Step 4&colon; Open CS&colon;GO and select the game process.</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">First run CS:GO and wait for it to fully load. After, go back to your injector and click the &quot;Select process&quot; tab.</p>
		
		<img src = "selectprocess.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of the 'Select Process' tab on your injector"/>
		
		<p class = "mainText">After clicking on this tab, you will then see a list with all the current processes on your computer. Scroll through the list to find the CS&colon;GO process &lpar;csgo.exe&rpar;. Click on the process 
		once you find it and click &quot;Select&quot;.</p>
		
		<h2 class = "step">Step 5&colon; Inject your cheat.</h2>
		
		<p class = "mainText">Now that everything is setup, you can inject Meme Hook by clicking &quot;Inject&quot;. The injector will notify you that it is injecting the cheat and afterwards, a menu will pop-up on your CS:GO 
		game window. This is the toggle-based menu which allows you to turn on&sol;off certain features of our cheat by clicking on selection boxes. Have fun cheating with Meme Hook!</p>
